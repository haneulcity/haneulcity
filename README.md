Welcome to HaneulCity - A huge city map project.
Its map has been built since 2013 and published on [my own blog(Korean)](https://pbdiary.pw). However, in Korea, many people are not interested in MCPE. Now, I changed my plan for this map and Github Publishing is one of changed plan.

If you want to contribute to this map, please contact [to my twitter account](https://twitter.com/lego37yoon2) or [email me](mailto:lego37yoon@outlook.com). I don't operate server for this map, so schedule set is needed.

For Android:
1. Download File from Versions Tab or Download Zip for Master Branch.
2. Extract with ZAchiver or Zipper/Zipper 7/Zipper 7 2.0.
  * Please check "Create New Folder for this Zip file" before extract.

3. Check whether files are in there correctly, and enjoy!

For Windows 10 Edition:
1. Same as Android
2. Extract with Bandizip or Windows Default Zip Extractor.
  * Please check "Create New Folder" Option is enabled.
  * PLEASE DO NOT USE ALZIP TO EXTRACT THIS FILE. ALZIP IS THE WORST CHOICE TO EXTRACT SOMETHING.
  * Before Extracting, Check "Show Hidden Files" option is enabled at Windows Explorer Settings.
  * Run Extractor as Admin Permission is recommended. Because Extracting folder is in your AppData folder.
  * Extracting folder is (Windows Installed Drive)/Users/(Your Username)/Appdata/Local/Packages/Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds
