## How to Install
NOTICE: I used BandiZip, Zipper 7 2.0 or Github Internal ZIP program to archive it. You can extract this with any other programs, but OWN YOUR RISK. If you ask me for help, I cannot help you ESPECIALLY when you use ALzip to extract this.

For Android:
1. Download File from Versions Tab or Download Zip for Master Branch.
2. Extract with ZAchiver or Zipper/Zipper 7/Zipper 7 2.0.
  * Please check "Create New Folder for this Zip file" before extract.
  * Extract output folder should be /storage/emulated/0/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds
3. Check whether files are in there correctly, and enjoy!

For Windows 10 Edition:
1. Same as Android
2. Extract with Bandizip or Windows Default Zip Extractor.
  * Please check "Create New Folder" Option is enabled.
  * PLEASE DO NOT USE ALZIP TO EXTRACT THIS FILE. ALZIP IS THE WORST CHOICE TO EXTRACT SOMETHING.
  * Before Extracting, Check "Show Hidden Files" option is enabled at Windows Explorer Settings.
  * Run Extractor as Admin Permission is recommended. Because Extracting folder is in your AppData folder.
  * Extracting folder is (Windows Installed Drive)/Users/(Your Username)/Appdata/Local/Packages/Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds
3. Same as Android.
