Welcome to HaneulCity - A huge city map project.
Its map has been built since 2013 and published on [my own blog(Korean)](http://pbdiary.pw). However, in Korea, many people are not interested in MCPE. Now, I changed my plan for this map and Github Publishing is one of changed plan.

If you want to contribute to this map, please contact [to my twitter account](https://twitter.com/lego37yoon) or [email me](mailto:lego37yoon@outlook.com). I don't operate server for this map, so schedule set is needed.
